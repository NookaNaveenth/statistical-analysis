Statistical Analysis in Python with iris Datasets
I can help you generate a README file, but I'll first need to understand the contents of the `.ipynb` file you uploaded. I'll review the notebook and then create a README for you. Let's take a look.

The notebook you uploaded is a comprehensive guide on **Statistical Analysis using Python**. It covers fundamental concepts in statistics, such as populations, samples, descriptive and inferential statistics, and provides practical examples using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, and statsmodels. The notebook appears to be designed for educational purposes, helping users understand and apply basic statistical methods to real-world datasets.

### Key Sections:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the importance of statistical analysis in data science and machine learning.
2. **Basic Concepts in Statistics**: Explanation of populations, samples, and the need for sampling.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Discusses measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and more.
4. **Inferential Statistics**: Covers hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.
